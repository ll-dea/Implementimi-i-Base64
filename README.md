# Implementimi-i-Base64
- Project Description

This project, developed by Dea Llapatinca, Dion Gashi, Dion Bogaj and Diell Do√ßi from the University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina" under the supervision of Prof Blerim Rexha and Ass. Mergim Hoti, focuses on implementing a Python program for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Base64.This project is a simple command-line tool for encoding and decoding text using the Base64 encoding scheme. Base64 is commonly used to encode binary data into a text format that can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols like email or HTTP.

- Features:

Encoding: Convert plain text into Base64 encoded strings.
Decoding: Convert Base64 encoded strings back into plain text.
Interactive Command-Line Interface: Allows users to continuously encode or decode multiple texts without restarting the script.
Error Handling: Provides feedback on invalid inputs and handles encoding/decoding errors gracefully.
User Instructions: Clear guidance on how to use the tool, including how to exit the application.


- Configuration Requirements

No special configurations are needed to run this program. As long as you have Python installed on your device, you should be able to execute the script without any additional setup. Simply follow the instructions provided above to use the program on your device.
 
- Expected results 

The expected result of this project is a fully functional Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Base64.
